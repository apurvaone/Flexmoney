I have implemented the problem in an android application, I have used cloud firestore database from firebase to store the data of yoga classes participants across batches.

In my application i have used NoSQL database called called Firestore. Similar to other NoSQL databases cloud firestore is also based on Collections and Document Structure.
So basically there are two Collections with mentioned attributes

          * Participants
              * name
              * age
              * contact
              * batch_id
              * payment_status
              
                  
          * Batches
              * timing
              * capacity
              * filled
